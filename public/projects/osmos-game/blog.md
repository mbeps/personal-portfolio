# **Team Project Reflection: Osmos Game**

# **Preliminary Considerations**
The undertaking of our second-year university project represented more than just a pedagogical exercise—it was an immersion into the intricacies of collaborative dynamics, synergized through the prism of game development. "Osmos", as a game, became a touchstone of our collective creativity, skillsets, and problem-solving acumen. 

# **Strategy and Structuralization**
A robust strategy is pivotal to navigating the labyrinthine process of game development. In our case, this foundational strategy was articulated through rigorous planning, with an emphasis on documenting every facet of the game's mechanics. Such rigorous documentation wasn't a mere procedural formality; it crystallized our conceptual roadmap and solidified our collective understanding of the project's objectives.

# **Adopting Agile with Trello**
Recognizing the mutable nature of our game's requirements and our own evolutionary learning curve, an agile model was identified as the optimal approach. Trello, in this paradigm, became more than a tool—it was our operational compass. 

Through Trello, our abstract game ideas metamorphosed into structured tasks. It offered a panoramic view of our progress trajectory, delineating what had been accomplished, and more importantly, what lay ahead. Furthermore, this platform enabled a strategic allocation of tasks, predicated on the individual skillsets of team members, ensuring optimal utilization of each member's expertise.

# **The Quantitative and Qualitative Measurement of Effort**
Given the heterogeneity in our team's skill levels, it was imperative to measure developers not just qualitatively, based on the output, but also quantitatively, in terms of effort. It's worth noting that more experienced developers, owing to their proficiency, often had the capacity to integrate more features. However, effort measurement provided a balanced evaluation metric, ensuring that every team member's contributions were acknowledged and valued equitably.

# **Feedback Mechanisms**
Our iterative refinement process was significantly enhanced through weekly presentations to our supervisor. These weren't mere status updates; they were structured feedback loops, pivotal for validation and directional recalibration, ensuring our project remained aligned with its envisioned trajectory.

# **Team Dynamics and Disagreements**
Our iterative refinement process was significantly enhanced through multiple channels of feedback. First and foremost, our weekly presentations to our supervisor offered a critical external perspective. These sessions weren't just about offering status updates; they were structured feedback loops that were pivotal for validation and directional recalibration. They ensured our project remained anchored to its envisioned trajectory.

Equally crucial was the feedback within our team. Given that each member was entrenched in distinct facets of the project, our collective insights offered a comprehensive view of the game's development. Team meetings often transformed into brainstorming sessions, where ideas were not just presented but also critically examined. This internal feedback mechanism ensured that our design and execution phases were continually refined and that any potential pitfalls were proactively identified and addressed. In essence, this dual feedback structure, blending both internal and external insights, fortified our development process and enriched the final product.

# **Technical Aspects**

The foundation of our project, CodeSkulptor3, presented both challenges and unique learning opportunities; this was a requirement for this project. As an obscure module in the vast landscape of development libraries, it was far from the conventional choice for game development. Its unfamiliarity meant that the bustling communities of YouTube tutorials and StackOverflow discussions, which developers often lean on, were virtually non-existent for our needs. We found ourselves diving deep into the documentation provided, and more often than not, our professor became an indispensable resource for navigating the complexities of this library.

But beyond the challenges posed by the unfamiliarity of CodeSkulptor3 was the intricate task of building the game's physics from the ground up. This wasn't just a game development project; it was also an exercise in applied mathematics. The manual implementation of physics using vectors required a rigorous theoretical understanding before any line of code could be written. Simulating phenomena like object bounces in vector space and gravitational pulls required us to chalk out the math behind each interaction meticulously. 

I found my A-Level maths training being put through its paces. The challenge lay not just in comprehending the mathematical principles but in translating that understanding into functional Python code. It was akin to crafting our very own game engine, building every mechanism piece by piece, fueled by mathematical logic. Despite the complexities, this process was invigorating. The intersection of theoretical math with practical coding was both demanding and immensely rewarding. It was a testament to the versatility of Python programming and the depth of mathematical modeling, converging to breathe life into our game.

# **Conclusion**

Embarking on this project was a journey of discovery, stretching both our technical capabilities and our teamwork skills. We navigated the labyrinth of an obscure library, devised our physics from scratch, and transformed abstract mathematical concepts into a tangible gaming experience. This wasn't merely about creating a game but a testament to the interplay of creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking.

The challenges we faced, be it disagreements in approach or the sheer complexity of translating theory into practice, enriched our learning experience. Through constructive feedback loops, diligent planning, and leveraging the unique strengths of each team member, we turned potential roadblocks into milestones. 

In retrospect, while CodeSkulptor3 pushed us out of our comfort zone, it also granted us an unmatched learning curve, proving that sometimes the road less traveled does indeed make all the difference. As we move forward in our academic and professional journeys, the lessons imbibed from this project will undoubtedly act as guiding beacons, reminding us of the potent blend of persistence, collaboration, and innovation.
