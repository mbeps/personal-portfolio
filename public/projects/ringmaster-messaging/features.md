## **Authentication and Account Management**

The system has several key user authentication and account management features designed to ensure that users have a seamless and secure experience:

- **Email Sign-up:** Ringmaster allows users to sign up using their personal email and create a unique password. This provides a traditional method of registration and access to the platform.
- **Third-party Authentication:** Users have the option to sign up using third-party authentication providers such as Google and GitHub. This allows for quick registration and eliminates the need to remember another password.
- **Login/Logout:** Users can log in and log out of their accounts easily, ensuring their account's security when they are not actively using the platform.
- **Password Reset:** If a user forgets their password, they can easily reset it. Ringmaster will send a password reset link to the user's registered email address, ensuring that only the user has access to change their password.
- **Profile Modification:** Ringmaster allows users to modify their profile settings, including their profile image and username. This gives users the flexibility to personalize their profiles according to their preferences and changing needs.

## **Real-Time Messaging and Group Chats**

Ringmaster offers a real-time, responsive messaging platform that enables users to send and receive messages instantly:

- **Direct Messaging:** Users can send direct, one-on-one messages to other users on the platform, enabling private conversations in real-time.
- **Group Chats:** Users can also create group chats, allowing for real-time communication with multiple users simultaneously. This is a perfect feature for coordinating with a team, planning events, or just having a fun conversation with friends.

## **Image Sharing**
- **In-Chat Image Sharing:** Users can send images within the chat itself. Whether it's a memorable photo, an important document, or a quick snapshot of something interesting, Ringmaster makes it easy to share with your contacts.
