# **Overview**

Understanding the technological jargon can sometimes be confusing, especially when it comes to terms like SDKs (Software Development Kits) and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Both are crucial for developing software applications, but they are not the same and serve different purposes. In this article, we will go into depth about both these concepts, how they work, and their key differences.

## **What are SDKs**

SDK, an acronym for Software Development Kit, is a set of software tools, libraries, code samples, processes, and guides that developers use to create applications for specific platforms. Essentially, an SDK is a box full of tools that a craftsman (developer) uses to create something (software). The tools can include documentation, libraries, code samples, processes, and guides that facilitate the creation of software applications.

The primary purpose of an SDK is to provide a standard way to create applications for a specific platform. For example, if you want to create an Android application, you would use the Android SDK. Similarly, if you're going to develop an application for iOS, you would use the iOS SDK.

## **What are APIs**

API, standing for Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. It's an interface that allows different software programs to communicate with each other. APIs define the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, and the conventions to follow.

In a nutshell, an API is like a menu in a restaurant. The menu provides a list of dishes you can order, along with a description of each dish. When you specify what menu items you want, the restaurant's kitchen does the work and provides you with some finished dishes. You don't know exactly how the restaurant prepares that food, and you don't really need to. Similarly, an API lists a bunch of operations that a developer can use, along with a description of what they do. The developer doesn't necessarily need to know how, for instance, an operating system builds and manages a file. They just need to know that there's an API function for this task, what it's called, and what parameters it needs.

# **How do they work**

## **How SDKs Work**

SDKs work by providing developers with a set of tools that make it easier to develop software for specific platforms or frameworks. For instance, an SDK may include a compiler that can turn the code written by the developer into a format that the target platform can understand and execute. Additionally, it may include libraries that provide predefined functionality, saving the developer from having to write common or complex pieces of code from scratch.

Furthermore, SDKs often come with extensive documentation and coding examples to help developers understand how to use the various components provided in the kit. This way, developers can focus more on creating unique functionalities for their application, rather than dealing with the intricacies of the platform they're building for.

## **How APIs Work**

APIs work as intermediaries that allow different software applications to communicate and share data with each other. When a software application needs to retrieve or send data, or wants to access specific features or functionalities of another service, it makes a call to the relevant API.

Consider a mobile application that shows weather forecasts. The app may not have its own weather data and algorithms to predict future weather patterns, so it uses an API provided by a third-party weather service. The app sends a request to the weather service API, specifying the location it wants the weather data for. The API takes this request, processes it, retrieves the necessary data from the weather service's database, and then sends this data back to the app. The app then takes this data and displays it in a user-friendly way to the user.

In a nutshell, SDKs and APIs are tools and interfaces that help developers build software applications more efficiently and effectively. SDKs provide a toolkit tailored for a specific platform or framework, while APIs provide a way for different software applications to interact with each other.

# **Why are SDKs and APIs Used?**

Both SDKs and APIs have crucial roles in the software development process, providing developers with capabilities that can significantly accelerate development, enhance interoperability, and extend functionality.

## **Speed Up Development**

The primary reason why SDKs and APIs are used is to speed up the development process. Both provide pre-built components and functionalities that developers can leverage, saving them from having to code everything from scratch.

**SDKs** typically come with libraries, compilers, debuggers, and other tools, along with code examples and documentation. These resources allow developers to focus more on implementing the unique features of their applications rather than spending time on lower-level details. For instance, instead of having to code how to draw a button on the screen, a developer can use a function provided by the SDK to create this button, and then focus on what happens when a user clicks on the button.

**APIs**, on the other hand, provide developers with access to external services and functionalities. They act as a bridge, enabling applications to use the capabilities or data of other software without needing to understand how that software works internally. This significantly reduces the complexity of development and accelerates the creation of feature-rich applications. For instance, if a developer wants to embed a map into their application, they can use a mapping API instead of having to create their own mapping software.

## **Improve Interoperability**

Interoperability, the ability of different systems or software to operate together, is another key reason for using SDKs and APIs.

**SDKs** provide a standardized way to develop software for a particular platform or framework. By using an SDK, developers ensure that their software can smoothly operate within the target environment, and effectively interact with other software built for that environment.

**APIs** enable different software systems to interact and share data with each other, regardless of how each system is implemented. They define a standard interface for communication, which can be used by any software that understands that standard. This means that a software developed in one programming language or running on one platform can use an API to interact with software developed in a different programming language or running on a different platform.

## **Extend Functionality**

Both SDKs and APIs allow developers to extend the functionality of their applications by leveraging the capabilities of external software or services.

**SDKs** include libraries that provide a wide range of functionalities, from rendering graphics and playing sounds, to accessing hardware capabilities like sensors and network communications. By using these libraries, developers can easily extend the functionality of their applications without needing to code these functionalities themselves.

**APIs** provide access to the functionalities of other software applications or services. This allows developers to extend the capabilities of their applications beyond what they could achieve with their own resources. For instance, a developer could use a social media API to allow users to share content directly from their application, or a cloud storage API to enable users to save data in the cloud.

# **How do SDKs and APIs Differ?**

While SDKs and APIs are both instrumental in the process of software development, they serve different roles and their properties differentiate them in some critical ways.

## **SDKs are More Comprehensive Than APIs**

One of the primary differences between SDKs and APIs is the breadth and depth of what they offer.

**SDKs** are more comprehensive, providing a complete set of tools, libraries, documentation, and other resources necessary for developing applications for a specific platform or framework. An SDK typically includes one or more APIs, along with compilers, debuggers, and other development tools, making it a "one-stop-shop" for developers. It provides the framework within which the software is developed, setting the foundation for how the application interacts with the platform it is built for.

On the other hand, **APIs** are more like individual building blocks. They define specific methods for software components to communicate with each other. While an API might be included as part of an SDK, on its own, it doesn’t provide the same breadth of resources and tools that an SDK does. APIs focus on the communication between different software components, serving as a contract that allows different pieces of software to interact without needing to know the specific details of how the other one works.

## **SDKs are Platform-Specific, While APIs are Not**

Another crucial difference between SDKs and APIs is their level of specificity to a platform or environment.

**SDKs** are typically platform-specific or framework-specific. They are designed to be used for developing applications for a particular operating system (like Android or iOS), a specific platform (like PlayStation or Xbox), or a specific framework (like React or Angular). This specificity allows developers to fully leverage the features and capabilities of the target environment, but it also means that the software developed with a specific SDK may not be compatible with other platforms or frameworks without substantial modifications.

**APIs**, however, are not typically platform-specific. They provide a set of rules for interacting with a particular service or system, and these rules can be implemented in any environment that supports the protocol used by the API (like HTTP for web APIs). This means that APIs can be used to enable communication between software components that are developed for different platforms, or in different programming languages. For example, a web API could be used by a web application running in a browser, a desktop application running on a computer, or a mobile application running on a smartphone.

In conclusion, while both SDKs and APIs are critical for software development, they differ in their scope and specificity. SDKs offer a comprehensive suite of development tools tailored to a specific platform or framework, while APIs provide a way for software components to interact with each other, regardless of their implementation details or target environment.

# **Advantages and Disadvantages of SDKs and APIs**

Just like any other tools, SDKs and APIs have their own sets of advantages and disadvantages. Understanding these can help developers make more informed decisions about when and how to use these resources.

## **Advantages of SDKs**

**They provide a lot of functionality out of the box**: SDKs typically include libraries, APIs, compilers, and other tools that provide a wide range of functionalities. This can make it much easier for developers to implement complex features or capabilities, without having to code these from scratch.

**They can make development easier and faster**: By providing a standard way to develop software for a specific platform or framework, and by including pre-built components and detailed documentation, SDKs can significantly accelerate the development process. They abstract away many of the complexities of the platform, allowing developers to focus more on their application's unique features.

## **Disadvantages of SDKs**

**They can be difficult to learn**: Because SDKs are comprehensive and often complex, they can be challenging to learn, especially for less experienced developers. Each SDK may have its own conventions, best practices, and ways of doing things, and understanding these can take time and effort.

**They can be tightly coupled to a specific platform**: SDKs are typically platform-specific, meaning they are designed to be used for developing software for a specific operating system, platform, or framework. While this can be an advantage when developing for that specific platform, it can also be a limitation if you want to develop cross-platform software or if you want to switch to a different platform in the future.

## **Advantages of APIs**

**They are more flexible than SDKs**: APIs define a set of rules for interacting with a specific service or system, and these rules can be implemented in any programming language or platform that supports the protocol used by the API. This makes APIs more flexible than SDKs, as they can be used to enable communication between software components regardless of their specific implementation or environment.

**They can be used to integrate with different platforms**: APIs, especially web APIs, can be used to integrate an application with a wide range of other software or services. This can extend the capabilities of the application beyond what could be achieved with its own resources. For example, an API can enable a mobile application to integrate with social media platforms, mapping services, payment gateways, and more.

## **Disadvantages of APIs**

**They can be more complex to use**: While APIs provide flexibility, they can also be more complex to use compared to SDKs. APIs only provide the rules for interaction, so developers may need to write more code to manage these interactions, handle errors, and transform data.

**They may not provide as much functionality as an SDK**: APIs focus on the communication between software components, so they typically do not provide the same breadth of functionality that an SDK does. For instance, while an API may allow an application to request certain data from a service, it won't provide the tools to display that data in a user-friendly way – that part would be up to the developer to implement.

In conclusion, both SDKs and APIs have their own strengths and limitations. Developers should choose between them based on the specific needs of their project, their own expertise and comfort level, and the platforms they are targeting.

# **Examples of SDKs and APIs**

2. **Payment Processing**: APIs from companies like Stripe or PayPal allow applications to process financial transactions, enabling users to make payments directly within the app.

3. **Weather Forecasting**: Applications can use APIs from weather services like OpenWeatherMap or Weather.com to display weather forecasts to their users.

# **The Future of SDKs and APIs**

In the future, we can expect both SDKs and APIs to continue evolving and becoming even more essential tools in software development.

**SDKs** will likely become more streamlined and easier to use, with better documentation and more robust tools. We may also see more cross-platform SDKs, which would allow developers to write their software once and have it run on multiple platforms. In addition, as new technologies like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and artificial intelligence (AI) continue to mature, we can expect new SDKs to emerge that enable developers to leverage these technologies.

**APIs**, on the other hand, are becoming more prevalent with the increasing trend of microservices architecture where each microservice exposes its own API. As more services move to the cloud, APIs will continue to play a pivotal role in enabling these services to interact with each other. We can also expect APIs to become smarter, more secure, and more performant, able to handle more complex tasks and larger amounts of data.

In both cases, as our technological landscape continues to evolve and become more interconnected, the roles of SDKs and APIs in software development will only continue to grow in importance.

# **Conclusion**
