#### **Technical Skills:**

- **Backend Development**: Built full-stack monolithic applications with Spring Boot as the backend. Developed scalable microservices including authentication service (with OAuth), email service, and LDAP permission service. These microservices became the backbone for Symphony bots and frontend applications, enabling rapid deployment of new business solutions.

- **Database Management**: Designed optimised database solutions using PostgreSQL (with fully normalised schemas) and MongoDB. Improved data integrity and query performance across critical business applications.

- **CI/CD Pipeline Development**: Implemented automated testing and deployment pipelines using TeamCity and SonarQube. Reduced deployment time from hours to minutes whilst eliminating production errors.

- **Front-End Development**: Built responsive user interfaces using Next.js, React, and TypeScript that improved user workflows. Delivered applications like the Rates App providing instant access to financial data and Application Status dashboard centralising system monitoring for hundreds of users.

- **System Architecture**: Designed efficient, reliable, and fault-tolerant system architectures using the correct tools for each job. Ensured business continuity and prevented service interruptions.

- **Containerisation**: Containerised infrastructure using Docker, including Symphony components, databases, and other services. Reduced server requirements by 40%, cut infrastructure costs and improved operational efficiency whilst improving system reliability.

- **Codebase Modernisation**: Refactored legacy application with significant technical debt into modern, modular framework. Reduced development time for new bots by half and delivered £30,000 in immediate cost savings through in-house re-implementation.

- **AI/ML Integration**: Implemented OpenAI API integrations for CobaGPT Bot. Built MCP servers for agentic AI to interact with ServiceNow and HR API, enabling users to carry out actions and retrieve data using natural language. Improved workflow efficiency for hundreds of users through early enterprise AI adoption.

- **Enterprise Security**: Implemented role-based access control using LDAP and Entra-based SSO for authentication. Ensured secure access whilst enabling rapid development and simplified user experience without storing sensitive information.


#### **Soft Skills:**

- **Cross-functional Collaboration**: Collaborated with internal and external users to deploy applications, automations, and bots bank-wide. Coordinated integration across 10+ business teams.

- **Leadership & Mentorship**: Mentored interns and conducted interviews for intern candidates. Reduced intern onboarding time by 40% through structured guidance and best practice implementation.

- **Problem-Solving**: Identified critical architectural bottlenecks and implemented modernisation solutions. Eliminated 80% of maintenance overhead whilst allowing faster feature delivery. Identified areas where automations could be applied and implemented those solutions, such as MDM data compilation which reduced processing time from 4 hours to 1 minute.

- **Rapid Technology Adoption**: Mastered complex infrastructure setups within weeks. Enabled on-schedule project delivery despite evolving technical requirements.

- **Adaptability**: Successfully transitioned between diverse technology stacks and project methodologies whilst maintaining delivery quality across all assignments.

- **Project Planning**: Executed complex technical migrations with zero downtime. Designed scalable architectures and created comprehensive documentation that reduced onboarding time for new team members by 60%.

- **Technical Communication**: Facilitated critical vendor negotiations and stakeholder discussions. Explained technical requirements in business terms to secure project approval and budget allocation.
