#### **Technical Skills:**

* **Symphony Bot Development**: Developed Java and Python Symphony bots that eliminated manual communication processes and automated repetitive tasks, reducing operational overhead by hours per day across multiple departments.
* **Backend Development**: Built scalable microservices using Spring Boot that became the backbone for all Symphony bots and frontend applications, enabling rapid deployment of new business solutions.
* **Database Management**: Designed optimised database solutions using PostgreSQL (with fully normalised schemas) and MongoDB, improving data integrity and query performance across critical business applications.
* **CI/CD Pipeline Development**: Implemented automated testing and deployment pipelines using TeamCity and SonarQube, reducing deployment time from hours to minutes whilst eliminating production errors.
* **Front-End Development**: Built responsive user interfaces using Next.js, React, and TypeScript that transformed user workflows. Delivered applications like the Rates App providing instant access to financial data and Application Status dashboard centralising system monitoring for hundreds of users.
* **System Architecture**: Designed fault-tolerant system architectures achieving 99.9%+ uptime, ensuring business continuity and preventing costly service interruptions.
* **Containerisation**: Containerised Symphony infrastructure using Docker, reducing server requirements by 40% and cutting infrastructure costs whilst improving system reliability.
* **Cloud Migration**: Helped with AWS to GCP migration that reduced cloud infrastructure costs by 25% whilst improving system performance and scalability.
* **Codebase Modernisation**: Transformed legacy monolithic architecture into modern, modular framework that reduced development time for new bots by 60% and delivered £30,000 in immediate cost savings through in-house implementation.
* **AI/ML Integration**: Implemented OpenAI API integrations for CobaGPT Bot, demonstrating early adoption of enterprise AI solutions that improved workflow efficiency for hundreds of users.
* **Enterprise Security**: Implemented role-based access control using LDAP and Entra-based SSO for authentication. This approach ensured secure access whilst enabling rapid development and simplified user experience without storing sensitive information.
