#### Technical Skills

- **Symphony Bot Development**: Used Java and Python to develop Symphony bots. Improved communication efficiency and automated repetitive tasks, saving time for other work.

- **Database Management**: Worked with relational databases (mostly Postgres) and non-relational databases (mostly MongoDB). Designed fully normalized database schemas (for relational databases) and added database policies.

- **CI/CD Pipeline Development**: Using TeamCity and SonarQube to automatically run tests and deploy code to development, preproduction, and production environments.

- **Front-End Development**: Creating user interfaces for Spring Boot APIs using NextJS, React, and TypeScript.

- **Containerization**: Containerizing Symphony components like agent server, pod, and key manager using Docker. This simplified system management and allowed multiple instances on the same server, reducing costs by minimizing the number of servers needed.

- **Cloud Migration**: Managed the transition from AWS to GCP to reduce costs for the bank.

- **Codebase Modernization**: Led the transition from an outdated, monolithic Java codebase to a more modular one with newer technologies. This made the code more maintainable. New bots can be created faster, adding business value quicker. Less time is wasted on maintenance.

#### Soft Skills

- **Team Collaboration**: Collaborated with Symphony to modernize the codebase. Worked with other departments to implement robust bots across the bank. Coordinated with development and operations teams.

- **Problem Solving**: Identified inefficiencies in the legacy codebase and led the development of a new modular codebase. Implemented automations to handle repetitive tasks.

- **Fast Learning**: Quickly learned the infrastructure setup. Learned technologies to implement workflows and various new technologies.

- **Adaptability**: Adapting to new technologies, processes, and environments.

- **Planning**: Planned migrations, designed code architectures, and wrote detailed documentation. Managed tasks using Jira.

- **Communication**: Communicated with Symphony for codebase migration. Coordinated with various teams and departments. Clearly communicated technical ideas and collaborated effectively with team members.
