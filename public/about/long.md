### Education

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Royal Holloway University of London, graduating with First Class Honours. Following that, I earned a Master's in Artificial Intelligence from King's College London, graduating with Distinction. Both universities are well respected.

### Technical Knowledge

I am proficient in Python, Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript, with exposure to various other languages and programming paradigms.

My technical skills cover both theoretical foundations and practical development. I have a strong Maths background, including calculus, algebra, linear algebra, logic, statistics, and mechanics - all crucial for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning work.

I apply software engineering best practices like testing, design patterns, and DevOps principles in my work. I am experienced with both SQL and NoSQL databases, including database normalisation and working with different ORMs. For backend development, I mainly use Spring Boot and Flask, though I've also worked with Django, FastAPI, and Express.js. I've built projects using managed solutions like Firebase and Supabase too. On the full-stack side, I work extensively with Next.js for building modern web applications.

### Projects

My project experience spans full-stack development, AI, and backend software engineering. These include personal projects, academic assignments and professional projects.

#### Full-Stack Web Apps
I've built several web applications using modern technologies like TypeScript, Next.js, and React.js. Circus Discussions, my undergraduate final project, is a social media platform built with Firebase that enables community-driven discussions, user communities, and commenting features. Magician AI is a SaaS platform I developed that combines various AI APIs, authentication and payment processing for subscriptions, enabling users to generate various media types and have conversations.

#### Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
In the AI and ML space, I've worked on several projects using Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. I developed classification models for Adult Income Prediction and regression models for House Price Prediction based on coastal distance. Both projects emphasised feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model optimisation. My Reinforcement Learning Lab explores various algorithms including Q-Learning, Deep Q-Learning, and A3C. The Machine Learning & Data Science Lab focuses on generative models, third-party models, and advanced techniques like transfer learning, LLM Agents, and Generative Models. 

My Master's dissertation investigated alignment and misalignment in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on hybrid-reasoning models. I developed a novel fine-tuning technique built on Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA). This approach successfully trained the models while preserving their core reasoning abilities, a capability that my research showed was lost when using standard supervised fine-tuning methods.

#### Backend Services
Professionally, I've contributed to enterprise-level software development, creating proprietary projects using Java and Spring Boot to build microservices. These projects involved working with different databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

### Experience

I currently work as a backend software engineer at Commerzbank, primarily developing with Spring Boot and Java to build micro-services and Symphony bots. My role involves database management, where I choose between MongoDB and PostgreSQL based on project requirements. When working with PostgreSQL, I ensure proper database normalisation. I collaborate closely with the operations team on infrastructure and deployments, maintain CICD pipelines using TeamCity, and containerise our micro-services using Docker.

During my time at RHUL x Google Developers Club, I worked on various team projects including Noodle. We used project management tools like Trello and implemented CICD pipelines to track and organize our work effectively. I'm also active in the open-source community, contributing to projects like the GNOME shell.
