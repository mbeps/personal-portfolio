I am a Software Engineer with a passion for building robust applications and exploring intelligent systems. I am currently based in London. My career blends active professional software development with advanced academic research. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Commerzbank. I also hold a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence from King's College London and an Undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Royal Holloway University of London. 

### Professional Experience

At Commerzbank, I operate within the engineering sector, specialising in building microservices, automations, and full-stack applications. I developed scalable microservices using Spring Boot that serve as the backbone for various Symphony bots and frontend applications. My work includes delivering responsive user interfaces using Next.js, React, and TypeScript. Notably, I built the Application Status dashboard, which has been highly successful and is widely used across the bank to monitor application health, solving a critical problem where no easy monitoring solution previously existed. Additionally, I developed the Rates App, which enables front-office users to instantly access interest rate data sourced from Bloomberg and Refinitiv.

My role extends significantly into infrastructure and DevOps. I successfully containerised the Symphony infrastructure using Docker, which made it far easier to maintain on-premise components and significantly enhanced monitoring capabilities. To ensure reliability, I designed fault-tolerant system architectures that maintain high uptime. I further optimised development workflows by implementing automated CI/CD pipelines using TeamCity and SonarQube, drastically reducing deployment times.

On the security front, I implemented robust role-based access control using LDAP and Entra-based SSO to ensure secure authentication without compromising user experience. Beyond technical deliverables, I actively mentor interns, accelerating their onboarding process through structured guidance.

A defining achievement in my professional career has been the strategic migration of legacy systems. I successfully re-engineered a suite of automations, including the Symphony Translate Bot, Blog Bot, and RSS Bot. I transitioned these tools from an outdated codebase laden with technical debt to a modern, modular architecture. This transformation significantly reduced development time for new bots and delivered immediate cost savings through in-house implementation. By leveraging current Java and Spring Boot standards, I eliminated security vulnerabilities and drastically improved code readability, resulting in solutions that are faster, more reliable, and significantly easier to maintain.

### Academic Foundation

My academic journey began at Royal Holloway, University of London where I graduated with First Class Honours in Computer Science. This undergraduate programme provided me with a comprehensive understanding of software design, algorithms, and system architecture. I worked on varied modules ranging from Object Oriented Programming to Information Security. My final year project focused on full-stack web development, where I built a social media platform.

I deepened my expertise through my MSc at King's College London, where I achieved a Distinction. My studies focused on advanced concepts such as Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Agent-Based Systems. My individual research project investigated "Alignment in Large Language Models". I specifically looked into hybrid-reasoning models and novel training techniques to solve forgetting issues in supervised fine-tuning.

### Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence

Beyond standard software engineering, I have a deep technical specialisation in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, underscored by my Master's degree with Distinction in AI. My expertise spans the entire machine learning lifecycle, from theoretical research to practical implementation. I have developed sophisticated models using Python frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn, tackling complex problems such as handwritten digit classification with CNNs and creating custom Q-Learning agents.

My research on Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of novel hybrid training techniques that address catastrophic forgetting in reasoning models. I actively document my findings in detailed technical blogs, dissecting advanced topics like Quantisation, Transformer architecture, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Furthermore, I hold multiple certifications in machine learning and deep learning, validating my ability to apply state-of-the-art algorithms (from neural networks to reinforcement learning) to solve real-world challenges.

### Full-Stack Development

I possess a strong background in web development. I am proficient in modern languages including TypeScript, JavaScript, Python and Java. My preferred tech stack often involves Next.js and React for creating responsive user interfaces. For back-end services, I rely on robust frameworks like Spring Boot and Flask. I have applied these skills to build critical internal tools for the bank, as well as in personal projects like a car dealership platform and real-time messaging applications.

### Community & Open Source

I actively contribute to the wider developer community. I have developed open-source extensions for the Gnome desktop environment to improve user productivity. Previously, I served as a Software Engineer for the Google Developer Student Club at Royal Holloway. In this role, I collaborated with peers to build an open-source learning platform. These experiences have refined my ability to work effectively in collaborative team environments.

### Continuous Growth

I am committed to continuous professional development. I hold certifications in Symphony Bot Development and various machine learning specialisations. My portfolio includes a diverse range of projects. I constantly seek to expand my knowledge base and apply my skills to solve challenging real-world problems.
