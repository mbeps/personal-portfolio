I hold a First-Class Honours degree in Computer Science from Royal Holloway University of London and am currently pursuing my Master's at King's College London in Artificial Intelligence. My academic background includes a strong mathematical foundation in domains like Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics while having substantial knowledge in the field of programming, software engineering, and Machine Learning.

Proven experience with Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript; experience with relational and non-relational databases for management and design. Practical experience in Machine Learning, data processing, and web development. Further areas of proficiency: leadership, task management, and development of top-notch, well-documented code.

Currently working as a Backend Software Engineer at Commerzbank, most of my assignments involve software engineering in backend system development. This job further enforces my problem-solving skills, teamwork, and leadership. My earlier work experience as a Maths tutor improved my communication and also helped manage my time more effectively.

I've contributed to various projects, including Circus Discussions: a social media application with TypeScript using Next.js and React on top of Firebase; here, I implemented CI/CD pipelines and used Docker for deployments efficiently. The House Price Prediction project allowed me to predict housing prices using the Random Forest and Linear Regressor algorithms, using Scikit Learn and Pandas. I also contributed to Noodle, a student learning platform, where I managed the tasks and timelines; this improved my project management and organizational skills.

Besides formal education, I have enriched my knowledge with diverse online courses on programming, web development, DevOps, and AI. I am actively contributing to the GNOME Foundation, having provided feedback and mockups for the Quick Settings feature in GNOME 43. Meanwhile, at Google X RHUL Developers Club, I participated in web development projects with students. In this way, both experiences have developed my technical and collaborative skills further in order to be successful in either an individual or team-oriented environment.
