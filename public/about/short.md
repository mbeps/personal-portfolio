Greetings! I'm Maruf, a **software engineer** from Royal Holloway University with a First Class Honours in Computer Science. My journey is driven intensely by **curiosity** and an unyielding passion for innovative technology.

My experience spans the **software development lifecycle**. Yet, I see every day as a new opportunity to learn. With a penchant for **constantly adapting**, pushing boundaries, and challenging the norms, my explorations have led me into the depths of **Machine Learning** and **Mathematics**. Presently, I'm deepening my understanding of advanced ML techniques.


Outside the realm of code, my passions include football, badminton, science literature, and travel. Every day is an adventure, and I believe in **seizing every moment** with **unbridled enthusiasm**.
