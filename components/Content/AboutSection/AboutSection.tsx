              Hello there! I&#39;m Maruf, a{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">software engineer</span> fueled by{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">
                curiosity, innovation, and an insatiable desire to explore the
                depths of technology
              </span>
              . Currently, I am pursuing my BS in Computer Science at Royal
              Holloway University, London.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Software engineering for me is akin to conducting an orchestra - a
              <span className="font-bold"> symphony of codes</span> that come
              together to create something remarkable. From developing APIs to
              building intricate front-end architectures, I&#39;ve dabbled in
              all parts of the{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">software development lifecycle</span>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              My technical interest extends beyond full-stack development to{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">Machine Learning</span> and{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">Mathematics</span>. To further my
              knowledge, I&#39;m currently delving into advanced Machine
              Learning techniques.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Additionally, my passion for{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">efficiency</span> and streamlining
              operations has drawn me to{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">DevOps</span>. I&#39;m currently
              engaging with the principles of continuous integration, testing,
              deployment, and monitoring through Udemy.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              When I step away from the computer, I engage in a multitude of
              hobbies. From football and badminton to immersing myself in
              science-based literature and traveling, I believe in{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">
                seizing the day and living life to the fullest
              </span>
