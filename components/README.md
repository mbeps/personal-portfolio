The `components` folder in the root of the `app` directory contains reusable UI components that are used throughout the application. These components serve various purposes and provide consistent visual elements and functionality across different parts of the application. Here's a general description of the functionality of the `components` folder:

1. **Reusable UI Components**: The `components` folder contains reusable UI components that can be used in multiple parts of the application. These components are designed to be modular and encapsulate specific functionality or visual elements. Examples of reusable UI components include buttons, forms, navigation bars, modals, alerts, and input fields.

2. **Consistent Styling**: The components in the `components` folder typically follow a consistent design and styling approach to maintain a cohesive visual identity across the application. They may utilize CSS-in-JS solutions like Styled Components or CSS modules to encapsulate styles within the component and avoid CSS class conflicts.

3. **Layout Components**: The `components` folder may include layout components that define the overall structure and organization of the application's pages or sections. These components provide a consistent layout for headers, footers, sidebars, and other structural elements.

4. **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**: HOCs may be present in the `components` folder. These components wrap other components and enhance their functionality or behavior. HOCs can be used for tasks such as authentication, routing, or data fetching, providing a reusable and declarative way to apply certain behaviors to multiple components.

5. **Component Composition**: The components in the `components` folder are often composed together to build larger, more complex UI elements or page layouts. This promotes code reusability and modularity, allowing developers to create new UI elements by combining existing components.

6. **Custom Hooks**: The `components` folder may also include custom hooks that encapsulate reusable logic or state management for specific functionalities. These hooks can be used across different components to provide consistent behavior or data handling.

7. **Route-Specific Components**: In addition to the global `components` folder in the root of the `app` directory, each route may have its own `components` folder. These route-specific components are tailored to the unique requirements of that particular route and may contain components that are specific to that route's functionality or visual representation.
