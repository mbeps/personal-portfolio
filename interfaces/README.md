The `types` folder in the project contains files that define custom TypeScript types and interfaces used throughout the application. Let's explore the functionality of the `types` folder:

1. **Custom Type Definitions**: The `types` folder contains files that define custom types and interfaces tailored to the specific needs of the application. These type definitions can represent various entities, data structures, or concepts used within the application, such as users, messages, conversations, API responses, or any other relevant domain-specific entities.

2. **Type Safety**: By defining custom types and interfaces, the `types` folder promotes type safety within the application's codebase. TypeScript allows developers to statically type-check their code, preventing common runtime errors and providing enhanced IDE tooling. Custom types and interfaces defined in the `types` folder help ensure that the application uses the correct data types and adheres to specific data structures or contracts.

3. **Code Clarity and Documentation**: Custom types and interfaces improve code clarity and act as a form of self-documentation. By providing meaningful names and defining the expected shape of data, types and interfaces make the code more readable and understandable for both developers and maintainers. They serve as documentation for the expected data structures and help in understanding the purpose and usage of various entities or data flows within the application.

4. **Consistency and Reusability**: The `types` folder promotes consistency in data modeling by centralizing type definitions. It ensures that different parts of the application use consistent data structures and prevents inconsistencies or mismatched types. Custom types and interfaces can also be reused across components, functions, and API responses, providing a unified and reusable vocabulary for representing data.

5. **Type Refactoring and Maintenance**: The `types` folder simplifies refactoring and maintenance tasks. When making changes to the application's data models or structures, updating the relevant types in the `types` folder helps identify the affected areas and ensures that the codebase remains consistent and error-free. It allows developers to quickly locate and update the necessary type definitions in one central location, reducing the likelihood of errors during refactoring.

Overall, the `types` folder enhances the application's codebase by providing type safety, code clarity, consistency, and reusability. It facilitates better understanding of the data structures used in the application, improves maintainability, and contributes to a more robust and error-free development process.
