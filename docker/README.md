This repository comes with Docker configuration files to enable you to build and run the Next.js application in a Docker container, a lightweight, stand-alone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

# **Repository Structure**

The Docker related files are located within the `docker` directory at the root of the repository. The `docker` directory has the following structure:

```
docker/
├── docker-compose.yml
└── next/
    └── Dockerfile
```

- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose file for orchestrating multi-container Docker applications.
- `next/Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for the Next.js application.

# **Docker Compose File (docker-compose.yml)**

Docker Compose is a tool that allows us to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. It uses YAML files to configure the application's services and performs the creation and start-up process of all the containers with a single command.

In this project, the `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to run the Next.js application.

Here is a breakdown of what each part does:

```yaml
version: '3'                     # The version of Docker Compose to use
services:                        # Define the services that should be created
  nextjs:                        # The name of the first service
    build:                       # Specifies the options that Docker should use when building the Docker image
      context: ..                # The build context specifies the location of your source files
      dockerfile: docker/next/Dockerfile  # The name and location of the Dockerfile 
    ports:                       # Expose ports
      - 3000:3000               # Maps the internal Docker host port 3000 to the external Docker client port 3000
```

By using this `docker-compose.yml`, you can bring up your entire app by using the command `docker-compose up` and bring it down using `docker-compose down` from the directory that contains the `docker-compose.yml` file. This will take care of all the intricacies of setting up the Next.js service.

# **Services**
## **Dockerfile for Next.js Application (next/Dockerfile)**

The Dockerfile contains instructions Docker uses to build a Docker image. In this project, we have a Dockerfile specifically for our Next.js application located under `docker/next/Dockerfile`. This Dockerfile instructs Docker to create a multi-stage build for the Next.js app.

The Dockerfile for Next is explained in the `next` section.
